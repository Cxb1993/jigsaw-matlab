<b>JIGSAW</b> is a Delaunay-based unstructured mesh generator for two- and three-dimensional geometries. It is designed to generate high-quality triangular and tetrahedral meshes for planar, surface and volumetric problems.

<b>JIGSAW</b> is a stand-alone mesh generator written in C++. This toolbox provides a <b>MATLAB</b> // <b>Octave</b> interface, including file I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing facilities. <b>JIGSAW</b> is currently available for 64-bit Windows and Linux platforms.
